Dear Diary,

I must have pulled off a masterstroke on the tic-tac-toe game. It has been over 24 hours and my opponent still hasn't
made his mind up on his countermove. I am looking forward to seeing the strategy he'll try to pull off, and expect to see
a response by dawn of the morning to follow.

Dear Diary,

Though there are still a few hours on the clock, a response seems to be beyond todays horizon. It would be fair to say
that the command git pull might really have an impact on my mental stability. Is this what it's like to be an astronaut?
But no matter how many times the terminal will tell me I'm already up to date, I will never bow my head.
