Yo Kevin, even ter info. Vandaag is een belangrijke wedstrijd, waarbij ik erover denk om vol op de counter te spelen. De tactiek van Atalanta is hier deels van op invloed. Jij zei dat hij niet al te sterke wingers heeft. 3-5-2 op de counter, of moet ik juist zijn verdediging onder druk zetten? Take care, en succes vanavond.

AC Milan Weaknesses

Decreased skill of backs
2 World class strikers, followed by 85-rated
Question: Downside of 3-5-2?





Answer: Proposed formation runs from midfield, strong opportunities to counter or shoot from distance. Opens up to wingplay, but only if offensive midfield players on the wing are the teams playmakers. 
       
Following up on the matter of playing counterplay: excellent choice. Use as many all-round midfielders as possible and defense, midfield and offense are to stay in place. Counterplay will posistion midfield wherever necessary, keeps defence behind and leaves strikers up front ready to strike.

Addition: 3-3-2-2. This formation is slightly more defensive. Jorginho, Fernandinho and Arthus provide defenisive stability, Pogba and Vidal should be enough creativity up front. Aguero and Felix should do the trick up front. Centre backs are vulnerable, hence the defensive midfield. 


KEVIN: Could definately work, the only risk is in the fact if the middle 5 are seen by OSM as a midfield area. If so, why isn't it called 3-5-2 B. Besides, a countering midfield should have all players able to both defend and attack. This could however be the case since even their weaker ratings are quite high. So if you trust in OSM taking the 3-2 midfield as a whole, this could work out very well.

Johnny: Thanks, I sure expect OSM to understand our thought process, since it's been intensile reviewed. What about the tactics on your team? Who are you playing?
